In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.</p><p>It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.</p><p>France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.</p></div><h1><a href="/charlotte/2014/03/29/ca-accolades/">Charlotte Accolades</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>2014-03-29 17:24:36 UTC</span></p><div class=content><h4>Charlotte’s National Rankings and Accolades for 2013</h4><ul><li>Top 10 Best Cities for Foodies Oct. <em>2013 CreditDonkey of all cities</em></li><li>No. 4 Best City for Jobs for Fall 2013 Sept. <em>2013 Forbes Small Business / CNN Money.com of 100 cities</em></li><li>No. 7 Top Cities for Small Business <em>Aug. 2013 Nerdwallet.com of 20 largest cities</em></li><li>No. 5 Top State for Business <em>July 2013 Area Development Special Magazine of all states</em></li><li><strong>No. 6 in Human trafficking</strong> <em>www.allwewantislove.org</em></li></ul></div><h1><a href="/jekyll/update/2014/03/29/yo-jekyllrb/">Yo Jekyll!</a></h1><p class=author><span class=date>2014-03-29 00:00:00 -0400</span></p><div class=content><h1>&#39;Allo, &#39;Allo!</h1><p>You now have</p><ul><li>Jekyll</li><li>Html5 Boilerplate based templates</li><li>jQuery and Modernizr</li><li>Sass and Compass</li><li>redcarpet markdown parser and Pygments highlighter</li></ul><p>installed.</p><p><strong>Enjoy coding!</strong></p></div><!-- Pagination links --><div class=pagination><a href="/">&laquo; Prev</a> <a href=/index.html>1</a> <em>2</em> <span>Next &raquo;</span></div></section><footer><div class=contact><p>Max Lee<br>Human<br>maxwellworx@gmail.com</p></div><div class=contact><p><a href=https://github.com/sangey>github.com/sangey</a><br></p></div></footer></div></body></html>
